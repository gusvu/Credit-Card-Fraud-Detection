# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
I have used a credit card fraud data set to predict fraud using various methods such as Logit, Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Network and Gradient Boosting.

The file was too large to upload so I broke the files down into the data prep, and each of the differnt methods.

I have knitted and uploaded word documents that are easier to read then my code.
